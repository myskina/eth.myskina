# My Awesome Token (MAT) Smart Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract defines a custom ERC20 token called My Awesome Token (MAT). It includes functionalities for minting new tokens and burning existing tokens.

### Contract Details

- **Token Name:** My Awesome Token
- **Token Symbol:** MAT
- **Solidity Version:** 0.8.18

## Features

1. **Mint Functionality:**
   - Allows minting of new tokens to a specified recipient.
   - Increases the total token supply and recipient's balance accordingly.

2. **Burn Functionality:**
   - Allows burning (destroying) of tokens held by a specified account.
   - Decreases the total token supply and the account's balance.
   - Includes a check to ensure the account has sufficient balance before burning.

## Usage

### Minting Tokens

To mint tokens, call the `mint` function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to mint.

```solidity
function mint(address recipient, uint amount) public {
    // Function logic to mint 'amount' tokens to 'recipient'
}
